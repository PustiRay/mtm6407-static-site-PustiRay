# 🧘 Top 5 Tips for Minimalist Living

Minimalism is about living more with less. Here are some practical tips to start:

---

### 1. Declutter Your Space  
Start with one drawer or shelf. Ask: “Do I need this? Do I love this?” If not, donate or discard.

### 2. Prioritize Quality over Quantity  
It’s better to own one great jacket than five average ones. Invest in pieces that last.

### 3. Adopt Mindful Consumption  
Before buying anything, pause. Do you truly need it? Could you borrow it instead?

### 4. Simplify Your Schedule  
A cluttered calendar causes mental noise. Cancel what drains you. Make space for what matters.

### 5. Take a Digital Detox  
Try turning off notifications for a week. Reclaim focus. Unsubscribe. Uninstall what you don't use.

## 🧡 Bonus Tip  
Minimalism isn’t about deprivation — it’s about alignment. When your space reflects your values, your energy shifts.
